Camel SMB Component
===================
This project is a Samba Camel component build on top of JCIFS (http://jcifs.samba.org/).

It was originally developed by Redpill Linpro AB and Helsingborgs stad as part of a integration project.

This component is licensed under the LGPL (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt)

Since we could not find a easy to integrate CIFS server implemented in Java the unit testing 
currently requires that a local CIFS server (Samba or MS Windows share).
Also copy camelsmb.prp.template to your home directory, rename it to camelsmb.prp" and edit 
to include correct details.
